/// Remembers whether a path exists, for the duration of one action-menu build.

/// <remarks>
/// Almost every built-in action checks whether every selected result still exists. Without this cache,
/// opening a menu asks the filesystem the same question about the same paths once per action, on the UI
/// thread where the static half of the menu is built.
/// Measured at 5.4us a path that exists and 14.9us for one that doesn't, a selection of fifty thousand
/// rows meant well over a second of the window being frozen before the menu appeared.
///
/// Caching per build makes that eight passes into one without changing a single verdict. It also makes
/// the eight agree with each other, which they previously needn't have: a file deleted between two of
/// those passes could enable one action and disable the next.
///
/// The cache lives only inside <see cref="BeginScope"/>. Outside one, <see cref="Exists"/> is a plain
/// filesystem call, so a caller that hasn't opted in behaves exactly as it did before, and no verdict
/// ever survives into a later menu.
