// caller's own already-known answer (the clipboard's "Preferred DropEffect" marker for a paste, a fixed
// copy for the quick panel's drop target), matching Explorer's own Ctrl+V semantics exactly,
// conflict-resolution prompt (file already exists?) included via IFileOperation's own default UI.
//
// Lives in the SDK rather than in the plugin that first needed it: the app's own quick panel copies
// dropped files this way too, and a built-in surface must not stop working because a plugin was
// disabled. Both reference this project already, so it is the one place both can see.

    //
    // onCompleted is for the callers that do need to know it landed -- a view showing the destination
    // folder has to be told, since nothing else will tell it. Raised on the shell worker's own thread
    // once PerformOperations returns, whether it copied anything or the user cancelled the dialog: the
    // only honest signal available is "the operation is over", and a view's answer to both is the same,
    // which is to go and look again.
