    // becomes "di01<SEP>ji.mp4", dots and digits intact), and it cannot occur in anything a user types,
    // so no query can straddle it the way "n.z" could straddle a printable '.' separator.

    // It also costs nothing on the hot path: being below 128 it keeps the alias pure ASCII, so the
    // byte-native matcher (Ascii.IsValid -> FzfBytePattern) still applies.
    //
    // Only the FULL-pinyin alias carries it. The initials alias is one character per source character,
    // so every position in it is already a boundary -- and the host detects that alias by its length
    // matching the source text (see PinyinAliasProvider.MapAliasToSourceIndices), which a delimiter
    // would break.
