// this side works out where the same delimiter would fall in what the user typed.
//
// It also carries the actual fix. A query only expands if every piece of it is a real syllable, so
// "gsh" -- three letters that are not a syllable sequence -- produces nothing here and is left with
// only the initials alias to match against, where it correctly finds no contiguous "gsh". Before the
// delimiter existed, that same query matched the concatenated full pinyin of 管理用户证书 across the
// 证/书 boundary ("…zhen[gsh]u") and dragged in a screenful of unrelated System Settings entries.
