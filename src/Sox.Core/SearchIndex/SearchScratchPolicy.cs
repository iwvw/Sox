/// How large a reusable search buffer is allowed to get before it stops being worth keeping.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The search path pools and reuses its working buffers because reallocating them on every keystroke was
/// measurable. What none of them did was ever give anything back: each grew to fit the biggest search it
/// had seen and stayed there, because Clear on a List or a Dictionary resets the count and not the
/// capacity. That was invisible while the full window asked for a thousand results; now that it asks for
/// every match on the drive, one search for a single letter sizes all of them for its own result count
/// and the service holds that for the rest of its life. Nor can a collection help, since these are
/// reachable from static pools and thread statics and so are not garbage.
///
/// So a buffer that grew past the budget below is released instead of retained, and only a search big
/// enough to have caused the problem pays for one reallocation next time.
///
/// The budget is in BYTES rather than entries, and is per buffer. Every one of these lives in a thread
/// static or a per-worker pool, so whatever is allowed here is paid once per core: on a 16-core machine
/// the matcher alone keeps seventeen of them. An entry count cannot express that, because the same count
/// means very different amounts for a 16-byte rank and a 32-byte match -- which is exactly how the first
/// attempt at this went wrong. Sixty-four thousand entries sounded modest and was 2MB per worker, so a
/// single broad query still ended with 18MB parked across the pool, all of it at precisely the retention
/// ceiling.
///
/// Measured to pick the number: an ordinary query returning 24k-41k results ends with its busiest worker
/// holding 2,048 entries, and a whole-drive query pins every worker at the ceiling whatever the ceiling
/// is. 128KB leaves ordinary use entirely untouched with room to spare -- 4,096 entries for the matcher's
/// hit list, twice the largest ever observed -- while capping what a broad search can leave behind at
/// about 2MB across all workers rather than 28MB.
