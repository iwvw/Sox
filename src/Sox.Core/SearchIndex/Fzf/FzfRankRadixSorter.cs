// radix sort is stable, so ordering by the tie-break FIRST and the key second leaves equal keys in

// so every row sharing a name shares its key, and a set of a few thousand ranks contains hundreds of
// such runs. Each was a separate List.Sort with its own bounds checking and a non-inlinable IComparer
// call per comparison, and together they cost more than the radix sort they were correcting.
