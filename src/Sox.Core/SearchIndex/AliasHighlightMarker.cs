// The alias-provider tier of HighlightMask's "final highlight result": when a term matches a candidate
// only through an alias provider (a CJK name found by its pinyin, or a query mixing a native-script
// character with alias-initial letters), the matched positions have to be mapped back onto the source
// text before they can be painted. Split into its own class (composition, not a partial class) to keep
// HighlightMask under the repository's per-file limit; this class has no state of its own, it always
// operates on the text/highlight span its caller passes in.

    // scores) even though the query never appears verbatim in the original text. Uses a plain greedy
    // earliest-position subsequence search per alias rather than the real FuzzyMatchV2 backtrace:
    // a polyphonic CJK name can expand to dozens of alias candidates here (PinyinAliasProvider allows
    // up to 32 combinations), and unlike a real file/folder name a synthetic pinyin string has no
    // camelCase/word-boundary structure for the real algorithm's bonus scoring to add value from -- so
    // paying its full DP cost per candidate measured slower overall than this simpler scan, for a mask
    // that (per real name/text) comes out effectively identical either way.
    //
    // The typed term plus a provider's own spellings of it. The rewritten forms are what actually
    // appear in its aliases -- a term typed as one run of letters is not present verbatim in an alias
    // that marks syllable boundaries -- so leaving them out means a pinyin search highlights nothing at
    // all. They are only ever compared against THAT provider's aliases, and MapAliasToSourceIndices
    // translates whatever matches (boundary characters included) back onto the original text.
    //
    // Cached because they depend on the term and the provider and nothing else, while this is reached
    // once per CANDIDATE: ranking a CJK query re-segmented the same pinyin term for every one of the
    // thousands of candidates in the refinement set, which was most of what that refinement cost.
