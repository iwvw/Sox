/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Both halves exist because of one measured symptom: XYplorer's file info tip could not stay visible while
/// the XYplorer plugin was enabled. Its tip is a plain tooltips_class32 of XYplorer's own process, and every
/// attempt lived 171-235ms -- the poller's own settle period. The read is the cause, not the event: for a
/// host whose path is read through a script API (XYplorer answers <c>&lt;curpath&gt;</c> over a WM_COPYDATA
/// round trip ON ITS OWN UI THREAD), the read cancels the transient UI the read was asked about. Proof by
/// subtraction: with no adapter or collector claiming the window -- so nothing reading it at all -- the tip
/// behaves normally.
///
/// Frequency alone did not fix it: spacing reads to one per interval merely changed which tips died (the
/// reported symptom became alternating, one short one long), because pointer movement inside the host keeps
/// asking. So asking is now gated on demand. Pointer movement is never demand: a file manager's panes and
/// status bar raise name-change and focus events continuously while the mouse moves, and those events are
/// indistinguishable from the ones a real folder change raises -- that is how a folder change reports.
///
/// Demand has three sources: a real foreground change (the user moved between windows, and the inline card
/// needs this window's folder the moment it opens), a keystroke that may summon the card, and the card being
/// on screen (its scope and dock still have to follow the host while it is up).
