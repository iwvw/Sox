// Split out of HookCommandHandler to keep that file under the line-count limit. Runs
// IInlineSearchAdapter's write-side methods (ExecuteItem/OnSelectionChanged/OnSearchFinished) here in the
// Hook process instead of the App process, so navigating a third-party file manager (Total Commander,
// Directory Opus, ...) still works when that file manager is running elevated and the App -- which never
// elevates itself -- would otherwise have its window messages silently dropped by UIPI. Mirrors the
// resolve-then-dispatch shape HookCommandHandler already uses for NavigateDialog/RestoreDialogFocus.
//
// Each call runs on its own freshly-spun-up STA thread (RunOnSta), not ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem and
// NOT the tracker thread that owns ExplorerTracker: some adapters (Explorer's IShellWindows/Navigate2/
// SelectItem, OneCommander's UI Automation) are STA-affine COM interop, so an MTA ThreadPool thread would
// force COM to marshal across apartments. A dedicated thread per call, rather than routing through the
// tracker thread, matters because at least one adapter (Total Commander) calls plain SendMessage with no
// timeout (see TotalCommander/Win32/Win32Helper.cs) -- if that target hangs, only this one call's thread
// leaks/blocks; ExplorerTracker's own WinEvent-based foreground/focus tracking (which runs on the tracker
// thread) keeps working for every other window and adapter regardless.
