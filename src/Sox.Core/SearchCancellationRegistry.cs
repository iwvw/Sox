/// A single slot for every directory-filtered search meant the fan-out of ONE keystroke cancelled its
/// own siblings: FileFilters publishes a keyword as a set of folders, the App issues one SearchDir
/// request per folder concurrently (ScopedSearchRunner), and whichever request reached the engine last
/// cancelled the others -- so all but that one folder silently came back with zero results, roughly
/// half of them per keystroke. Superseding per filter keeps the original intent (a newer search of the
/// same folder wins) without the fan-out cancelling itself.
