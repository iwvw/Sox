/// <summary>
/// Handles SearchRequestId.ApplyUpdate: verifies a staged update package and hands it to an elevated
/// process in the caller's own session, which is how an update reaches Program Files without the App ever
/// owning a runas/UAC prompt of its own.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is the privileged half of the update, so it takes its answers from the kernel and from its own
/// location rather than from the request: who is asking comes from the pipe handle (same pattern as
/// <see cref="HookLaunchRequestHandler"/>), and where the files land is this process's own directory. The
/// one thing trusted from the payload is which staging directory to read, and everything read out of it has
/// to carry a signature this code verifies before it is unpacked.
///
/// The unpacked payload deliberately lands in a subdirectory of the install directory instead of the temp
/// directory it came from, and that is the load-bearing detail: the temp directory is writable by the
/// (unprivileged) user whose update this is, so an elevated copier reading from it would hand that user's
/// malware a way to write arbitrary files into Program Files. The install directory is not user-writable,
/// and it is the directory the copier was going to be pointed at anyway.
///
/// There is no separate consent check because there is nothing to check against: this process is LocalSystem
/// and the "auto silent update" preference lives in the interactive user's own settings file. Being this
/// install's Sox.App.exe is the consent, and the App only sends the request when the user asked for it.
/// Verifying before answering also earns its keep: a package that can't verify should fail while there is
/// still a window on screen to say so in, not after the App quit to let an updater run that then refused to
/// touch anything.
