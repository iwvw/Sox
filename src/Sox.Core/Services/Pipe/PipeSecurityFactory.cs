    // integrity), and also AppSearchPipeService's search pipe (server is the App at standard integrity,
    // but a client run from an elevated/"Run as administrator" terminal needs to reach it too). Scopes
    // the ACL to just the actual user's own SID, not every authenticated user on the machine.
    //
    // NamedPipeServerStreamAcl.Create with THIS ACL -- not the simpler PipeOptions.CurrentUserOnly flag on
    // both ends -- is required specifically because of a subtlety in what "current user" means for a
    // Windows token: WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().User (used below) always reflects the actual logged-in
    // user's SID regardless of elevation -- UAC's split-token model changes a token's integrity level and
    // group memberships, not the identity it represents. But .NET's own PipeOptions.CurrentUserOnly
    // doesn't check that; it compares against WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent().Owner, and for a user who's a
    // member of Administrators, Windows sets the TOKEN OWNER to BUILTIN\Administrators on BOTH the
    // filtered and elevated tokens -- NOT the user's own SID. A non-elevated server created with
    // PipeOptions.CurrentUserOnly is fine for a non-elevated client (same Owner), but an elevated client
    // (e.g. `lff` run from an admin terminal) trips the CLIENT-side CurrentUserOnly check against a
    // server whose owner doesn't match either, throwing UnauthorizedAccessException ("was not owned by
    // the current user") even though the SID-based ACL below would happily have allowed it. This is why
    // BOTH the server (this ACL) and the client (a plain NamedPipeClientStream with no
    // PipeOptions.CurrentUserOnly of its own) need to avoid that flag entirely and let the ACL alone be
    // the enforcement (the pipe NAME can still embed the user+session for obscurity, but that's not an
    // OS-enforced boundary on its own).
