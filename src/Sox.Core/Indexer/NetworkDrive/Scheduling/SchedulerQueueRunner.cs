// Debounce-and-run queueing for refreshes -- extracted out of Scheduler (composition, not a partial
// class) to keep that type's files under the project's line limit. QueueRefreshDrive debounces bursts
// of requests for the same drive (e.g. several watcher events in a row); StartRefreshDriveIfIdle/
// RefreshDriveLoop make sure only one refresh runs per drive at a time, re-running immediately if
// changes arrived while it was busy. Shares Scheduler's own _gate/_debounceCts/_activeCts/
// _pendingRefreshDrives/_lifetimeCts by reference rather than owning copies, since both types need to
// observe and mutate the same live bookkeeping under the same lock.
