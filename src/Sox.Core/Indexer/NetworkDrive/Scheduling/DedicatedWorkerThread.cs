namespace Sox.Core.Indexer.NetworkDrive.Scheduling;

// Runs work on a dedicated, Lowest-priority thread instead of the shared ThreadPool. A large/slow
// background scan can otherwise saturate the ThreadPool (many workers doing blocking sync I/O) and starve
// unrelated Task.Run-based work -- including the app's own interactive search/launch code -- from getting
// a worker thread promptly. Lowest priority additionally lets the OS scheduler favor foreground UI work
// whenever there's real CPU contention -- most of a scan is network I/O wait (priority barely matters
// there), but TreeDiffBaseline's reuse-copy path on a resumed scan is a tight, genuinely CPU-bound loop
// with no I/O to yield on, which is exactly when this matters most. Neither change reduces throughput when
// the system isn't contended: idle cores run Lowest-priority threads exactly as fast as Normal ones.
// Wrapped back into a Task so callers keep normal Task.WaitAll/cancellation/exception-propagation semantics.
