// Thread-safe "should a checkpoint fire now" gate, shared by TreeBuilder (network/WSL/folder-index drives)
// and ReFsScanner's own mid-walk checkpointing (Core/Indexer/Usn/Journal/ReFsScannerCheckpointExtensions.cs)
// -- both walk in parallel across multiple worker tasks and both re-serialize their FULL accumulated state
// on every checkpoint (not a delta), so a flat interval would make total write volume grow with the SQUARE
// of the walk size: checkpoint k always costs O(k), and there are O(n/batchSize) of them. Doubling the gap
// after each checkpoint (capped at maxBatchSize) keeps total write volume within roughly 6-10x the final
// size regardless of how large the walk is, instead of many hundreds of times over on a multi-million-record
// one -- e.g. ~2.9GB total written for a 5M-record rebuild whose final snapshot is ~0.5GB. Chosen as a
// balance against the OTHER cost this trades against: how much of the walk has to be redone if the process
// is interrupted right after a checkpoint (worst case is one full cap's worth of items).
