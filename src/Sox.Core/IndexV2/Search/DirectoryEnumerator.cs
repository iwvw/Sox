// overlay, level by level. Cost is O(size of that subtree), not O(volume) -- the CSR is already a
// parent-directory dimension, it just had no recursive walker until now.
//
// Related to but not the same as PathSearch.TryDirectoryChildren, which lists ONE level as a ranked
// search result set for a path-mode query. This is a plain enumeration: no ranking, no fuzzy matching,
// an optional Win32 FILE-name filter, and it descends. Directories are returned alongside files but
// are never matched against that filter (see Visit), and neither recursion nor the hidden/system filter
// is gated by it either.
