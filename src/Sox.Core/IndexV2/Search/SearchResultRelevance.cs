// Builds the top 32 bits of RankSortKey for a name-mode result -- the part SearchResultRankComparer
// compares first (after history priority). Kept separate from NameSearch so the two search phases cannot
// quietly develop different sort-key semantics again.
//
// Three keys, in this order (matching the quick window's RankAndDedupe exactly):
//   1. match START position -- "left-side match priority": the leftmost match wins. A row whose name did
//      not satisfy the whole query (it was completed by an ancestor folder) gets the "no name match"
//      sentinel, so every name match outranks it.
//   2. match QUALITY weight (HighlightMask: coverage * contiguity).
//   3. match TIER -- how the match was found (literal name, initials alias, full transliteration; see
//      AliasMatchRules). This is the WEAKEST of the three: it only separates rows that already agree on
//      both position and coverage, so 英文 > 简拼 > 全拼 never overrides a better-placed or tighter match.
// Start above weight matters because the weight's coverage share structurally favours shorter names:
// ranking "wx" by weight alone put "iwxfe.mp" (2/8) above "wxfef.doc" (2/9) even though the latter starts
// the name. The engine's pre-existing span/length bits are kept as deeper tie-breakers in the low 32.
