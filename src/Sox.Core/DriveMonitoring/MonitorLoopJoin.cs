// Bounded wait for a drive monitor's own loop to finish before the per-drive index it writes into is
// disposed.
//
// Why it exists: a USN monitor's loop runs as a fire-and-forget Task that applies record batches into its
// drive's LiveIndex. UsnService.OnStop disposes that LiveIndex right after the monitors, and
// LiveIndex.Dispose reached ReaderWriterLockSlim.Dispose while the loop still held or awaited the same
// lock -- which throws SynchronizationLockException straight out of OnStop, terminates the whole service
// process (Windows then logs "Failed to stop service"), and was seen ten times in one machine's
// Application log between 2026-09-08 and 2026-09-19. Waiting for the loop here is what keeps that write
// out of a disposed index; LiveIndex.Dispose no longer letting that exception escape is the second,
// independent half of the same fix.
//
// Bounded on purpose: a service stop must never hang. The loops observe cancellation at their awaits
// (100-2000 ms Task.Delay calls plus a per-iteration token check), so the normal case returns in
// milliseconds; only a loop parked inside a synchronous FSCTL read can exceed the bound, and that case is
// logged rather than waited on forever. Four drives at this bound still sit well inside Windows' own
// service-stop timeout.
